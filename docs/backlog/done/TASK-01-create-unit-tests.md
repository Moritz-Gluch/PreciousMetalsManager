# TASK-01: Create Unit Tests

## User Story
As a developer, I want to have unit tests for all critical business logic and services, so that I can ensure the reliability of the application and prevent regressions when making changes.


## Acceptance Criteria

- Unit tests are implemented for:
	- CalculationService (current value, total value, edge cases)
	- DatabaseService (CRUD operations, error handling)
	- ExportService (CSV/Excel export, if implemented)
- Tests cover both typical and edge-case scenarios.
- All tests pass successfully before merging new features.
- Tests are run automatically.
- Test code is clearly separated from production code.


## Dependencies
- Core features and services must be implemented.
