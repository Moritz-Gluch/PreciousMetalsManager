# TASK-02: Centralize Error Messages

## User Story
As a developer, I want all error messages to be managed in a centralized location, so that they are easier to maintain, update, and translate if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All error messages used in the application are stored in a single file or service.
- UI and backend code reference error messages only from this centralized source.
- Adding, updating, or translating error messages can be done in one place.
- No hardcoded error strings remain in the codebase.

## Dependencies
- Existing error handling in the application.
