# TASK-06: Change Date to European Format

## User Story
As a user, I want all dates in the application to be displayed in the European format (DD.MM.YYYY), so that the information matches my local conventions and is easier to read.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All dates shown in the UI use the format DD.MM.YYYY.
- Date input fields and pickers accept and display dates in European format.
- Dates are stored in a format compatible with both display and database requirements.
- No US-style (MM/DD/YYYY) dates remain visible to the user.

## Dependencies
- Existing date handling and display logic in the application.
