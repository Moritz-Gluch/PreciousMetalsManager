# FEATURE-06: Dark Mode

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to switch the application to a dark mode theme, so that I can use it comfortably in low-light environments and reduce eye strain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The application provides a toggle or setting to switch between light and dark mode.
- All major UI elements (windows, dialogs, DataGrid, buttons, etc.) adapt their colors and styles to the selected theme.
- The selected theme persists between sessions (e.g., saved in user settings).
- The dark mode uses appropriate contrast and is visually appealing.
- No UI elements remain unreadable or visually broken in either theme.

## Dependencies
- Existing UI implementation and theme support in the chosen framework.
