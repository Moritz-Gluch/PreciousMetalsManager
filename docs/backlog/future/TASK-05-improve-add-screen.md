# TASK-07: Improve Adding of Data

## User Story
As a user, I want the data input dialog to be as convenient and intuitive as possible, so that I can quickly add and edit my holdings without confusion or unnecessary steps.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The input dialog is easy to navigate and clearly labeled.
- Use of dropdown instead of text field whenever possible and sensible.
- Comma numbers can be written with ',' and '.'.
- Input validation provides immediate, user-friendly feedback (inline messages, highlighting fields, etc.).
- Tab order and keyboard navigation are logical and efficient.
- Error messages and confirmations are clear and non-intrusive.
- The overall workflow for managing holdings feels smooth and efficient for the user.

## Dependencies
- Existing implementation of HoldingDialog.xaml and HoldingDialog.xaml.cs.
