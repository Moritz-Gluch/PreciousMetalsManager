# TASK-03: Improve UI

## User Story
As a user, I want the application’s user interface to be visually appealing, modern, and easy to use, so that managing my precious metal portfolio feels pleasant and efficient.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The UI uses a consistent, modern design language (colors, fonts, spacing).
- Key screens are visually clear and uncluttered.
- Buttons, labels, and controls are easy to find and use.
- Responsive layout: the application looks good on different window sizes.
- Visual feedback for actions (loading indicators, success/error messages).
- Accessibility is considered (keyboard navigation, readable contrast).
  
## Dependencies
